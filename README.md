# Cracking-Codes-With-Python

Here I uploaded all my projects which I created while learning cryptography
from 'Cracking Codes With Python' book, written by Al Sweigart,

While this projects are based on what I learned from Al's book, I wrote all of
them by myself, so you will find numerous changes and improvements.

Below is a full list of files included in this repository, together with
all dependencies. Each file also has its own description and is pretty
much self-explanatory.

## List of files and programs in this repository:
- reverseCipher.py - Encrypts/decrypts message using reverse cipher. Input is user's text string entered via terminal. Output is this string reversed (first character becomes last etc.). **Imported modules:**
    - pyperclip (not compulsory).
    
 - caesarCipher.py - Encrypts/decrypts message using Caesar Cipher. It is a simple shift cipher, which shifts all the symbols in a message by a given value, called 'key'. Input is user's text string and key (integer). Output is this string shifted ('upwards' for encryption and 'downwards' for decryption).
 **Note:** SYMBOLS constant must be the same for encryption and decyption of the message. It can be changed to match required list of symbols.
 **Imported modules:**
    - pyperclip (not compulsory).

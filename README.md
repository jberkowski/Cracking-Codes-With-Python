## Hi! Welcome to my repository.

Here I uploaded all my projects which I created while learning cryptography
from 'Cracking Codes With Python' book, written by Al Sweigart,

While this projects are based on what I learned from Al, I wrote all of
them by myself, so you will find numerous changes and improvements.

Below is a full list of files included in this repository, together with
all dependencies. Each file also has its own description and is pretty
much self-explanatory.
